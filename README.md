# eye-analysis-ML

Development of a multi-output CNN to analyze human eye ultrasound images. The CNN in question is a multi-output regression model. 

This project aims to develop a method to determine pathologies from ultrasound images, which are sensitive to blood flow, as well as other tissues that would not be visible through other imaging modalities.
