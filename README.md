# Multi-Output Regression CNN for Eyeball Ultrasound Analysis

Diagnosing medical pathologies is a key application of artificial intelligence, especially in recent years as the
success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has become increasingly prominent. One open research
problem in this area is to determine pathologies from ultrasound images, which are sensitive to blood flow,
as well as other tissues that would not be visible through other imaging modalities. 

The aim of this project is to work with ultrasound eye images to predict the horizontal and vertical diameter
of the eyeball. The model is a convolutional neural network regression model based on the Network in Network design.
